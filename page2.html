            <p>Elephants are among the most intelligent animals on Earth. They have excellent memories and can recognize themselves in mirrors, showing self-awareness. These gentle giants live in complex social structures led by the oldest female, called the matriarch, who guides the herd with her wisdom and experience.</p>

            <p>Baby elephants, called calves, are born after a 22-month pregnancy - the longest of any land animal. They weigh about 250 pounds at birth and can stand within hours. Calves stay close to their mothers for years, learning essential survival skills and forming bonds that last a lifetime.</p>
